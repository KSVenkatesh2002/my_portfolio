## 📊 Projects Highlight

Here are a few academic/demo projects I've worked on:

- **Dyer – Handloom Saree Work Management System** – A full-stack web application to manage traditional saree production workflows, including employee task tracking, product assignment, and salary management. Built using the MERN stack and integrated with Clerk for authentication.
- **Train Ticket Booking System (Java, MySQL)** – A demo project simulating a train reservation system, with features like booking, cancellation, and fare calculation. Helped reinforce my skills in database handling and Java-based GUI development.

These projects helped me understand practical software development workflows and sharpen my problem-solving and UI/UX structuring skills.
